Prompt #1 (ChatGPT): in markdown is ## bigger than ###
Answer: ChatGPT said: Good question — in Markdown, fewer # symbols mean a larger heading


Prompt #2 (ChatGPT): Can I have some examples of tests I could use for readligo.py?
Answer: 
Excellent — this is a really common task in the LIGO homework! You’re basically setting up unit tests for your readligo.py functions to make sure they work correctly.

Let’s walk through what to test and show you example test functions you can include in ligotools/tests/test_readligo.py.

1. Folder Structure
Your repo should look something like this:
ligotools/
│
├── __init__.py
├── readligo.py
└── tests/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_readligo.py
Make sure both __init__.py files exist (even if empty) so Python recognizes the folders as packages.

2. Understanding What to Test

The typical readligo.py (used in the LIGO tutorial/homework) defines a function like this:
def read_hdf5(filename, strain_chan=None):
    """Read LIGO hdf5 data, returning strain, time, and metadata."""
    import h5py
    import numpy as np
    with h5py.File(filename, 'r') as f:
        meta = dict(f.attrs)
        if strain_chan is None:
            strain_chan = list(f['strain'].keys())[0]
        strain = f['strain'][strain_chan][:]
        dt = f['strain'][strain_chan].attrs['Xspacing']
        t = np.arange(0, len(strain) * dt, dt)
    return strain, t, meta
If your version is similar, we can write tests that:

	Verify the output types (e.g., NumPy arrays, dict)

	Verify that the arrays have expected lengths or values

	Optionally test metadata fields exist

3. Dummy or Small Data File

If you can’t include full LIGO data (because they’re large), you can make a tiny test file like example_data.hdf5 with fake data — or mock the output of read_hdf5
